The gov has put them in a never ending conservatorship where they wont let them go. At one point for years they had all their profit going straight to the treasury. The government has since taken 100 billion over what they had owed and still they are stuck in the never ending conservatorship. a dollar stock with a company making billions every quarter. So can the government be beaten or should i just give up now?",

        "text": "Ok... $PARA is tanking after the Skydance acquisition deal fell through. The company's market cap is below $7 Billion. The PB ratio is 0.29.\n\nThis is a company that did $29 billion in revenue last year. The Paramount+ streaming service is the least profitable part of the company, and the leadership already admitted that they're looking to do a JV with another streamer to reduce their costs and churn.\n\nThey still have an extremely valuable IP library (the godfather, terminator, mission impossible, star trek, top gun, ninja turtles, spongebob), linear tv channels that throw off a lot of cash with NFL rights for eight more years, one of the top/ growing free streaming tv services in pluto tv, international tv networks that are less susceptible to cord cutting, and prime real estate in LA that's worth billions on its own.\n\nYes, the leadership is a mess right now, and it's a wildcard moving forward. Meanwhile the analyst class could not be more bearish on it, and it's the butt of all kinds of jokes in the hollywood trade media.\n\nBut, man, this company is undervalued. It's worth a lot more than its current $6.75B market cap. Period.\n\nAt a low valuation of 1x revenue it has almost 3x upside to the current stock price. It may not get there, but Apollo put in an acquisition bid at 26 billion, so it's not like some crazy pipe dream.\n\nThoughts???",

Customers increasingly want competition in the market & AMD will offer alternatives on-par in performance & likely cheaper. AMD will never become the market leader probably, but NVDA currently owns 92% of the market from what I have read. AMD has 3%. AMD has much more to gain & NVDA much more to lose. probably more upside to AMD than NVDA at this point at time as well, considering the run NVDA has been on. In truth, they are both going to be winners, but NVDA seems more of like a short term play given its current position whereas AMD seems more like a 1-3 year play.",

        "text": "NFE's main floating LNG facility dealt with multiple delays but is slated to finally be completed on Monday. FUD pushed the stock from $29.11 to $20.79 over the last 5 weeks on fears of further delays for that FLNG site. Those fears are clearly unfounded now that the company announced Friday that it'll be complete and online on 6/24/24. Guidance for this year is $5/share FFO. Dirt cheap versus the current price of $21.20. Meanwhile open interest for calls continues to grow and shorts haven't covered any of the \\~15m shares held short. 8/16 calls have over 30k open interest versus a tiny available float of 4-8m shares. Supply below $28 will likely prove to be very low and the double whammy of (shorts covering + dealers delta hedging) while shares start to appreciate should lead to yet another massive run up over the next 4-8 weeks. Stock squeezed twice from $27 - $34 (2 weeks) and then $27 -> $40 (4 week rally) in 4Q23. Best squeeze it's had was $16 -> $60 in 5 months in 2021. Insiders hold 48% of the 205m shares outstanding and the rest (50-52%) is held by institutions. CEO hold 36% of the stock and mgmt has previously discussed buybacks. I would expect a buyback plan to be announced during Q2 ER on 8/8 if shares are still below $30-35.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5uiq83jwc7d1.png?width=184&format=png&auto=webp&s=a64ab7f7976375615b1c77bcb6306296f267a985\n\n200DMA all the way at $31.41 should easily get touched on the next rapid rally.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm long shares & 8/16 $25 calls in size.",

Investing involves risk. \n\nENVX may add >$50B in market cap in a 1-2 year time horizon. \n\nRecent examples of significant market cap gainers are NIO, ROKU, and TWLO. All went from single digit billions to >$50B in a short time period. \n\nAll rapidly lost market cap in a short period as well. \n\nENVX is potentially months away from completing Site Acceptance Testing and about a year away from announcing mobile OEM purchase orders. \n\nIf ENVX completes SAT and lands a couple significant mobile customers in the next year the market may reprice the company significantly higher. ENVX could flirt with a $50B market cap by 2027. \n\nIf it does, the $50B to $250B examples may prove instructive. Or the stock could crash or never reach the $50B market cap level. I think $50B is feasible assuming the aforementioned milestones are met. \n\nI am an ENVX shareholder. This is my opinion. Do not trade on my opinion. Investing involves risk. \n\n\n",

        "text": "I've been following SiriusXM, ticker SIRI, for years. Recently, the stock has been shorted to new all-time lows. Currently, about 25% of the stock is shorted, with the majority of shares unavailable to trade due to John Malone and Liberty Media owning 81% of the shares. Shorts also need 5.46 days on average to cover their positions based on recent trading volumes. \n\nSiriusXM consistently generates significant free cash flow and profits each year. However, hedge funds continue to short the stock due to them being a legacy player. Much of the negative news has already been priced in, such as SIRI's removal from the Nasdaq 100. Post-merger with Liberty, the company will be eligible to join the S&P 500 due to not having a controlling shareholder anymore, presenting a major buying catalyst. \n\nThe cherry on top is that Warren Buffett has been heavily buying SIRI and Liberty shares over the past year. He continues to believe the company is undervalued, adhering to his strategy of buying when others are fearful. There has also been increased volume in the past couple weeks showcasing potential major whale buying. \n\nThe stock has been hammered from $6 to $3 in a matter of months, despite no significant changes in the company's operating dynamics. Naked shorting is at an all-time high, with clear signs of market manipulation.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Ticker SIRI presents one of the best asymmetric short squeeze opportunities in the market",

        "text": "As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold.\u00a0\n\nHistorically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the\u00a0 ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.\n\nFor AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity.\u00a0\n\nAs this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1. This would give you time to capture and news from August 2024 earnings the iPhone 16 release, the post election rally and Xmas spend.\u00a0",

Every single time I shorted, the stock would jump at least 5-10% in the following days. Almost every single day, a new all time high week after week.  Just a week ago, I reinforced at $59 and here we are teasing $66 today. So, I making my last one. I'll be shorting more stock today if it hits $66 and I want you all to make money instead of me. $70 Jun21 calls are cheap if you have some money to gamble, and Jul19 calls are a bargain too. The B/A spreads are garbage so invest at your own risk, but hey take solace in the fact that I'll be losing money no matter what. ",

They had been forecast to rise 0.2%, based on a Wall Street Journal poll of economists.\n\nSales in April were also revised to show a decline, instead of no change as originally reported.\u201d\n\nNow, you think people who are not spending money on their favorite clothes, shoes, and accessories are going to spend it on bar food and arcade games instead? Me neither. Yet, D&B\u2019s solution is to sell all food 50% off (applies to take out orders as well according to the subreddit), despite food already being a small margin earner. \n\n$PLAY is still up too much YoY, despite reported -40% revenue and profit in Q1.

What simplywallstreet and many other value investors understand is that the company is massively undervalued because of current momentum and past problems, but we aren\u2019t working with the past! On future cash flow and earnings Boeing is one of the best value buys in the entire market! Demand is massive and problems are being rooted out like bad teeth.\n\nA lot of people are out to sink the stock further looking to discount their future purchases, not much else! ",

Where do you get the idea, that the issues were in the past? Just these days new whistleblowers came forward, reporting about new malpractices and - worst of all - that people, who have concerns about safety and quality issues, are still being harrassed and silenced. This would mean, despite all public mea culpas, the culture of \"just push the crap out\" remains deeply entrenched, and that would mean, either the management is incompetent in it\u00b4s effort to change it, or it never intended to and still hopes, the storm will pass somehow. So no: None of the issues is in the past. We only know, how far at least they go back. And we know, that at least for several months the FAA won\u00b4t let Boeing increase it\u00b4s production.\nAnd all of that was already public knowledge, before it became known, that Boeings biggest plant is currently full of Dreamliners, who have been produced exactly as sloppy as the 737 Max and 787 and can\u00b4t be delivered.\nYes, if there was a management, that really was fighting to turn Boeing around and get it back on track, the company would take a beating but be a solid investment. But if they continue, to prirotize fighting unions over fighting malpractice, if they continue to prioritize numbers over safety, if they continue to prioritze money over lives, than this company, as hard as it sounds, can be run into the ground. And on top of all of that are the ever increasing risks of billions of dollars of compensation for airlinies and victims of Boeings malpractice.\nSo, I\u00b4d say no.

        "text": "First off, I have no idea what Jabil does. All I know is that the name sounds funny and it's releasing earnings on the 20th, and that it usually has huge swings after earnings. This is good because that means big profits = more tendies.\n\nThings don't get clearer on the quantitative side.\n\n[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/frmy0u0bk97d1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=519bc6d79c5c4117fd90aef04bab093def47b52a)\n\nWhat you're looking for in Figure 1 are the Net Income %Change vs Sentiment %Change, and Guidance %Change vs Guidance %Change Est. comparisons. Net Income %Change is my forecasted net income growth for the company using SARIMA models (which I find to be particularly effective for estimating revenue, and slightly less so for expenses), while Sentiment %Change is calculated with analyst EPS estimate revisions, stock price performance since start of quarter, and analyst forecasted EPS growth. Net Income %Change is supposed to be a proxy for projected results and Sentiment %Change is supposed to represent the bar that earnings will have to clear to result in a beat. As you can see, Sentiment %Change is currently lower than Net Income %Change, which means that Jabil will likely beat earnings.\n\n  \nBut wait! What about Guidance %Change and Guidance %Change Est.? These are new fields I added to my model using experience gleaned from LEN Lennar Corp. (for those who didn't see my previous post, the old version of my model correctly predicted the earnings beat but could not predict the slight guidance miss). These are supposed to be proxies for actual guidance and expected guidance. As seen in Figure 1, there's a significant chance Jabil Inc. will miss guidance estimates.\n\nI'm inclined to buy puts. What do you think, fellow regards?\n\nBy the way, I still think LEN can rise once market opens. Still an amazing earnings release.",

The Mobility business contributed $4.2B of revenue in FY23 (\\~12% of total revenue).\nOr how 2024 restructuring plan announced alongside the Mobility sale (announced 10/2/2023) will impact pre-tax earnings by $300 million?\nOr how management communicated they would accelerate share buybacks in FY24 given the earlier than expected completion of the Mobility divestiture?\nJabil's FY24 is (in their own words) a transition year.  If you accounted for the reduction in EPS from the divestiture of the Mobility business + the new pace of share buybacks, would you still come to the same conclusions?\nI don't think examining historical performance, without proper accounting of these corporate actions, has any predictive power",

        "text": "A few weeks ago I set out researching to find a company in the energy sector to invest into. My portfolios are mainly tech companies which I have no problem with. However I've wanted to find a company that isn't mainly tech, such as an insurance, energy, or real estate to diversify into. After researching screeners, articles, and other random shit on the internet I found Schlumberger ($SLB)\n\n-Also this isn't a very in depth analysis :)\n\nHere's a quick profile of the company if you've never heard of them.\n\n  \n-Schlumberger (SLB) is a leading global provider of technology and services to the energy industry. The company's offerings include solutions for reservoir characterization, drilling, production, and processing in the oil and gas sector. Schlumberger also focuses on digital technologies and services, supporting the industry's transition towards a more sustainable energy future.\n\nThe first thing that stood out to me about this company was their growth forecasts and valuation. Their companies valuation seems very fair, (PE-14.50) (PB-3.01) (EV/Sales-2.08) (EV/EBIT-12.07) (EV/EBITDA-8.63) Additionally, the future growth seems great, especially given the value right now. They're projected 13% revenue growth this year and 12% growth next year. As well as EPS growth of around 20% this year and next. The growth begins to slow after 2025 but it still seems like good growth and has potential to be revised upwards.\n\nThey have great free cash flow but it hasnt seen consistent growth. Great ROA, great ROE, and a solid balance sheet. Institutions have been increasing their ownership substantially since March. Almost all analysts recommend buy. \n\nI also believe SLB has a great competitive advantage(moat). They are the worlds largest oilfield services company with a more extensive global reach and a wider range of services across the oil and gas value chain. They have a comprehensive portfolio covering reservoir characterization, drilling, production, and midstream services. Generally a stable financial track record due to its larger size and diversified operations. They've collaborated with many great companies like Weatherford. They also constantly position themselves for the future with innovations, mergers, and acquisitions, such as their new merger with ChampionX Corp.\n\nThe company seems to have very little downside with great growth and great value. Some of the downsides I've noticed are, the lack of growth in USA and Canada's markets. They recently have pivoted away from North American markets. Lower activity in North America has impacted Well Construction revenue as well as all of the revenue streams from America. However this could be seen as a good thing since the company has been aggressively pivoting towards a more tech data based company. This seems strategic and great for the future to me. Another downside is the stock's graph. It seems to be going down and down without an end in sight, however; the companies growth has been great since covid(2020). Insiders and institutions have been loading up recently and as long as the company keeps growing the graph should begin to reflect and go up. Another downside is that the company is slightly controversial and their head of communications was recently banned from\u00a0*Wikipedia*\u00a0for self-authoring articles and using sock-puppet accounts.\n\nClearly the company isn't perfect but it has intrigued me immensely. I have opened a small position. Do you guys think SLB is an undervalued gem or a fairly valued, nothing special stock? I would love to know your guys thoughts and insights. Thank you for reading and responding.",

        "text": "I hope you enjoy reading the following story and decide that this is valid DD.\n\nWhat happened on the surface:\n\nOn Thursday 4:15PM EDT, Vaxart Inc announced they were granted a huge $453m grant by the US government. At that time, Vaxart was valued at ~$120m and traded at $0.75. Within 10 minutes SP shot up to more than $1.80 and then hovered around this level for about 2:30hrs, until they dropped a second PR, announcing a $40m offering @ $0.8 per share managed by Oppenheimer & Co. Inc that was expected to close today, June 17. Immediately, the share price started dropping under massive volume. During the next two trading Sessions, Friday (64m) and Monday (25.5m) the share price kept dropping relentlessly down to $0.525. For comparison, the average trading volume is now at 3m shares.\n\nMore details on the offering released today:\n\nToday's SEC 424B5 filing revealed that the offering is a private placement. Therefore, the additional shares will not be sold at the market and technically won't have an impact on the share price. Usually, these private placements boast the share prices of such small biotech companies (recently e.g. AVTX, ACRV, TNGX, TSHA).\n\nAlso, the filing revealed that Oppenheimer is allowed to short Vaxart, but has to buy back these shares at the market (see attached image).\n\n-> after shareholders we're throwing wild guesses over the whole weekend, trying to figure out what is going on, these two important details revealed the truth. Someone has built up a massive short position over the last two trading sessions, probably pretending that shares were being sold at the market. And this someone must be Oppenheimer. Of Friday's 64m traded shares, more than 50% we're short. Today, Monday a whooping 70% of the 25.5m we're shorted (link with short volume ratio attached, while the correct trading volumes can be found on Yahoo finance or trading view, among others).\n\nLong-time investors (from the very active Vaxart stocktwits community), although not exactly knowing what's going on, kept buying more shares on Friday, since the massive drop in SP was completely unintuitive. Remember, a $120m company receives $453m from the US government, thereby validating their business and potential. Having clarity, retail kept buying even more, making Oppenheimer building up on their short.\n\nSo, what now?\n\nIt is expected that Vaxart will soon, likely tomorrow 8am EDT, drop a PR announcing the closing of the transaction. With this PR, Oppenheimer will loose their incentive to manipulate SP further down and start to unwind their short position. Also, such statement would cause investors to buy up shares again, at least up to the offering price of $0.80.\n\nThey have shook the tree heavily the last two days, but at least the huge stocktwits community didn't sell, instead they heavily added. With additional buying pressure, Oppenheimer might have a hard time to buy back their shorted shares.\n\nThis post is exclusively about exploiting the current setup, Oppenheimers short position. Therefore, I will not go into further detail why Vaxart is a good and in the long-term a low risk - huge reward play. But in short, my expectation for the current situation is that the share price will easily and very shortly snap back to $2 with potential to run much further.\n\nNot investment advice, just food for thought.",

A manager I spoke to also implied they basically have no accurate accounting of their inventory which rings true from customer experience.\n\nUnlike other companies, they transact the purchase right away and in some cases don't deliver thousands of dollars of furniture purchases until 2 years +. \n\nDoes this not mean they might not be balancing their books correctly each financial quarter? How does that work?",

        "text": "\nHey WSB crew,\n\nJust wanted to give you all an update on my position in SLV $30 calls expiring on July 5th. I\u2019ve increased my position from the initial 69 contracts to 153 contracts. Here's why I'm still bullish on silver and why I believe this move is going to pay off big time.\n\nCurrent Position:\n- Total Contracts: 153\n- Average Price:  $0.14\n- Market Value:** $2,065.50\n- Total Cost:** $2,214.00\n\nWhy I'm Bullish on Silver (XAG/USD):\n\n1.  Technical Analysis:\n\n   - Silver recently bounced off key support levels and is showing strong bullish momentum. We are seeing resistance at around $29.57, but if it breaks through, we could see a significant upward movement. The technical indicators are pointing towards a continued uptrend.\n\n2. Economic Uncertainty:\n\n   - With the ongoing global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and potential recessions, silver is often seen as a safe-haven asset. This increased demand can drive prices higher as investors look for stability.\n\n3. Industrial Demand:\n\n   - Silver's industrial applications, especially in the tech and renewable energy sectors, are growing. The push for green energy and the increasing use of silver in electronics are boosting its demand. This industrial demand supports a strong bullish case for silver in the medium to long term.\n\n4. Market Volatility:\n\n   - Given the current market volatility, commodities like silver often benefit from increased buying as investors seek to hedge against stock market fluctuations. \n\n5. Recent Moves and Sentiment:\n\n   - The silver market has seen a lot of interest from both retail and institutional investors. The recent price movements suggest that there is a strong underlying demand, and the market sentiment is bullish.\n\nMy Strategy:\n\nI'm holding these calls because I believe that the market conditions are ripe for a bullish run in silver (YES. within 18 days).\n\n With silver currently priced at $26.92 and my break-even at $30.14, a move above $30 by July 5th could lead to significant gains.\n\nI'm keeping a close eye on the market and technical indicators, ready to adjust if necessary. However, the current setup and macroeconomic factors make me confident in my bullish stance.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and let's see how this play unfolds. To the moon! \n\nTL;DR:\n\n Increased my SLV $30 call position to 153 contracts. Still bullish on silver due to technical indicators, economic uncertainty, industrial demand, and market volatility. Break-even is $30.14. Let's ride this silver wave to the moon! \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or any other silver plays you guys are eyeing. Let's get this bread!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own research before making any investment decisions.*",

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.\n\nList of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.\n\n-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way\n\n-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)\n\n-License approved to test FSD is China\n\n-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.\n\n-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber\n\n-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.\n\n-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.\n\n-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)\n\n-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.\n\n-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.\n\n-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!!, no competition from china here.\n\n-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.\n\nThe big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.\n\nTSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.\n\nI have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.\n\nLastly the debate is over, Telsa is a Tech company, its a conglomerate like GE once was.",

        "text": "BlackBerry is about to have its earning call and on the docket will be the \"non binding\" reinstating of their compensation program for executives. You don't need me to tell you why this is a bad idea: BlackBerry is struggling and hitting lows while not putting much of anything useful out. This is no Elon Musk and the payment probably wouldn't have the same effect as Tesla. Let me break this all down using the [Management Proxy Circular](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/corporate-governance/2024/BlackBerry-Notice-of-Meeting-and-Management-Proxy-Circular-2024.pdf) and other facts:\n\n1. BlackBerry has had quite the history with their compensation plans. Last year, their plan passed with about a 80% margin ([link](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/corporate-governance/2023/report-of-voting-results-june-2023.pdf)). The plan involved their complicated equity bonus plan which gave their future CEO a bonus of $5M which was hundreds times more than his salary (look at the above linked MPC on page 36). It was bullshit and the next year the plan was rejected by a slim margin of 56% ([link](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/corporate-governance/2023/report-of-voting-results-june-2023.pdf)). This year they are trying to get it to be reinstated and you can read about it on MPC page 19. As said on page 36 as well the CEO is attempting to nearly quadruple his salary to over $8M from the 2.3M he made last year. You really think anyone will go for that this year when the company is pushing record lows?\n2. So we have two scenarios with this package. The first is it passes. The company will have to pay tons of money to the executives who have helped run this company into the ground, which would most likely trigger an intense sell off.\n3. Or it doesn't pass in which case the dire financials of the company will probably cause the same fall. AND THIS ISN'T EVEN CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE VOTE IS NON BINDING. So the execs could just say \"fuck you\" and give themselves tons of money anyways.\n\nTl;dr: BB is fucked and this earnings call is probably going to be rough because of voting section five.\n\nI am currently straddling the stock in anticipation of the earnings.\n\nI am also kind of dumb so I could be very wrong about this.",

        "text": "Today, I will be talking about Denison Mines ($DNN), and why I hold some shares and $3 LEAPS in them.\n\nAccording to their Q3 2023 report, \"Denison is a uranium exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan.\" Sounds great, but why is it undervalued? Well, it's pretty simple and also has two underlying reasons. The first is that the smaller uranium miners have been slower to react to the take-off of the uranium price in terms of their share prices and increased future cash flows. The second is that Denison won't produce any significant amount of uranium until 2028, after which the bonanza really starts. However, they have a great management team and plan, and have hit every milestone they've needed and wanted to in order to ensure they will indeed start mining in 2028. I have complete confidence both in their abilities to produce and that the uranium market will continue to be strong in the future. In fact, in will only get better. This is coupled with the fact that due to long lead times in the industry, any competition will be years and years away from being in the position that Denison is in right now, which is being profitable at the moment and in a great position for future mining.\n\nDenison derives most of their value from three things: their interest in the McLean Lake Uranium Mill, their holdings of 2.5 million lbs of enriched uranium, and most importantly, their Wheeler River mining project. Wheeler River consists of two deposits, the Phoenix deposit and Gryphon deposit. The following information about these deposits are from their Q3 2023 report.\n\nDenison's Phoenix site has U3O8 reserves of 56.7 million lbs, which have an estimated all-in mining cost of $16.04 USD per lb. Their Gryphon site has 49.7 million lbs of U3O8 reserves, with an estimated all-in mining cost of $25.47 USD per lb. I have actually constructed NPV analyses of both deposits, but I am only allowed to include one image, so I will show you the Phoenix NPV, and I'll just reference the Gryphon NPV and resultant figures down below.\n\n[Phoenix NPV at 8&#37; discount rate, which is industry standard for mining. Notice that they extract much more in the first 5 yrs than the next 5, which is their plan as referenced in their reports.](https://preview.redd.it/y5ef38i5g77d1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=a20445d51f4bc194963db29a498a9127c51137eb)\n\nAs you see, Denison is incredibly undervalued based on the new reality of current and future uranium prices. At prices of $100/lb USD, the Phoenix deposit has an NPV of $4.6B CAD, and the Gryphon deposit has an NPV of $3.7B CAD, for a valuation of the Wheeler River Project of $8.3B at uranium prices of $100/lb USD. Add in the value of their 2.5 million lb physical holding ($0.34B CAD) and assets ($0.614B CAD) minus liabilities ($0.08B CAD) and we arrive at a valuation of $9.174B CAD at a uranium price of $100/lb USD. At a uranium price of $200/lb, the valuation rises accordingly to $19.909B CAD. At any thing beyond that, you're going to have use the power of your imagination. I strongly believe both that Denison will have success with these mines and that the uranium market will be strong as a new normal. Due to a number of factors, like Kazatomprom issues, a possible US ban on Russian uranium imports, shortage of mines currently in use, increasing demand for nuclear power everywhere on Earth, the goals of net-zero by 2050, and myriad other supply problems and demand positives. In short, if I was an analyst working for Morgan Stanley I'd label this a \"strong buy\" and strongly advise that we buy out Denison to take the future profits for ourselves. Which brings me to my final point: Denison is a prime target for acquisition or merger with one of the larger uranium producers such as Cameco. Consolidation is bound to happen in the space, and it appears that some of the larger players are wanting to make some moves. A project such as Denison is a strong target for a possible buyout, which would deliver a strong return even earlier than the market correction due over this following year.\n\nThis valuation of $9.174B CAD at $100/lb (USD) uranium would be the same as $6.68B USD, which would correspond to a $DNN share price of around $7.50 per share. At $200/lb (USD) uranium, that share price is well over $15. Whether you buy Denison on NYSE or TSX shouldn't matter much, although I'd rather buy their USD shares since I believe that the USD will be stronger than CAD.\n\nDNN $5 Jan 2026 calls are at $0.15, and $3 calls are at $0.38. At my $7.50 price target, which I'll remind you is just a figure for approximation, these $5 calls would have a 1567% return and the $3 calls would have a 1084% return at expiry. At $15/share, the $5 calls would have a 6000% return. Do I think that Denison will reach $15, or even $7.50, by Jan 2026? I'm not 100% confident, which is impossible for any prediction like this, but I do think it's far more likely than the tiny chance that these LEAPS are pricing in.\n\nPositions: shares, Jan 2026 $3 calls, maybe gonna buy Jan 2026 $5 calls. This is my entire trading portfolio",

I think my luck streak is coming to an end so I plan on pulling more out tomorrow. But man it feels like a dream coming back like this. From down 9k on the year to up 9k. Maybe if I didn\u2019t withdraw so much along the way my gains would be more but\u2026. I\u2019m pretty happy with these results. Vacation monies. \nIf anyone cares for advice, I would say that my success besides mainly luck. Is a result of me being patient and not trying to come back all at once. Telling myself to never hold any more than a x4. No matter what the a sell order in for that price at most. But mostly uv only put out 1k at a time and never hold past my commitment I make myself when I buy the options. I also gave up on meme stocks or playing earnings outright. Now I strictly trade calls and puts on. SPY, NVDA, AAPL, BA, and TSLA. My big 5. \nAnd I have no reasoning behind my options I buy. I go straight on gut. I\u2019m so regarded the more i analyse the greater my chances I lose money. Positions are calls and outs in the top 5 I listed above.

Ive held an Nvidia call that was down 40 percent for a week and on the day before it expired I was up 120 percent. \nIf you buy calls get as close to the current price as you can, the price goes up, it's plus money on top of what you gained. Price goes down you lose money you paid in. As long as it's headed towards the price your call is at, you pile the gains. \nThat being said, Nvidia is showing its overbought.

Broadcom has a strong position in the specialty ASIC business as well as its robust software portfolio, and the company's AI revenues grew 280% from the prior year and was a beneficiary of capital expenditures by Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META). What are your thoughts?",

For me the integration of AI is just a bonus that can potentially make an already good app even better. \nIt\u2019s only been public for ~2 years, so I\u2019m not too worried about the current volatility. Good product/service (imo) + not many competitors + still a young company. \nThe biggest issue I see is working around their current revenue model whereby their \u201cPremium\u201d version is only a one-time $6.99 fee; and I can\u2019t imagine their free Ad-based alternative being highly profitable given how briefly people interact with it.\nRegarding that last point: it\u2019s ironically & unfortunately a great app lol so when I do use it, it only takes ~20-30 secs to identify a song and link to a 3rd party app that can play it\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

        "text": "On wednesday, i had made a post about SMCI, stating that it is a good investment to have due to the rise of AI and that SMCI has partnerships with big names such as Nvidia and AMD. I had also stated that the stock is undervalued as it had an ATH of around $1220 and that the stock price on wednesday, which was under $800, was a bargain. The next day of making that post, SMCI had reached $876 on the close. However, SMCI had reached a little over $920 today, which is well over $120 higher than what it was since ive made my post about the stock. This means that SMCI was up well over 8% today and up by 16% in the past week. However, i still believe that SMCI is still at a good value, as it has potential to reach over $960 which has been done before, and it could beat its ATH right around its earnings report.\n\nCurrently i own 7.5 shares of SMCI, which is 2.5 shares lower than what i owned on friday. Reason for this is to take profit and hopefully could dip buy at around $820 level, and if not, i may invest in ASTS or INTC as i believe they have a lot of potential for growth.",

        "text": "Greetings Regards,\n\nLike many institutional investors and mouth-breathing savages alike, I\u2019ve been bag holding $DAL for years. My pride and joy, this bad boy makes up 57% of my entire Robinhood portfolio. I have seen this stock react to every tide in the market since 2021, and I have a sensational tingling in my balls that we are going to experience an enormous, unidirectional rip between now and the election. \n\nIf your eyes aren\u2019t already open to the busy skies, this is your message to hop in. \n\nTSA has literally hit All-time highs in passenger traffic in the last month:  https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/tsa-memorial-day-travel-record/\n\nAnd this pace won\u2019t stop. What do people want to do? Fucking go places. It\u2019s deeply rooted in our nature. And I\u2019d be willing to bet that the upper middle class is about to have a wonderful summer flying premium economy. Where do you think all those boomers with NDVA gains will go? \n\nNow, for some regard-level DD data: \n\nDelta\u2019s stock valuation has not resurfaced to its pre-2020 levels. Between July and December of 2019, the LOWEST trading price was $51.07(!!) Look for yourself, Delta trades below this value today. Based on JUST INFLATION, $51.07 would equate to a price of $62.36 in 2024 dollars.\n\nOut of all major airline carriers, Delta reports quarterly earnings first. The grand day for the Q2 report is July 11th. I expect Delta to utterly destroy earnings, and lay down a huge green cock on the table for guidance going into the holiday season and beyond. There\u2019s really no reason not to.\n\nGranted, there was a period of time where Delta had to sit back and accept an industry-wide butt-fucking during 2020. But the rear view mirror has shined too bright on this stock. Back to back massive quarters are coming and there\u2019s no path for this airline to slow down anytime soon. If you like other airlines, I won\u2019t stop you! \n\n\nCurrent positions:\n257 shares @ $32.77 avg ()\n5x $50 Calls exp 9/20 @ $3.00/contract \n5x $52.5 Calls exp 12/20 @ $3.60/contract\n\nNear future/recommended positions: \n10x $57.5 Calls exp 9/20 \n10x $60 Calls (leaps?) exp 12/20 \n\nTL;DR: Delta flies a lot of people and stock Go up. \n",

Last week, orders of 1 and 2 were not being batched, but as of today, they have started to batch them. \nPrice paid initially reads 0.00 through my brokerage for roughly a minute. Unsure why this might be the case, but it seems to be unique to $BMBL and not the other companies I am investing in.\nThe option chain for $BMBL is so dry that I have to 2.5x the ask to hit, and it is filled at half the ask, even for miniscule orders.\n$GRND has had some truly 10/10 memes lately.

        "text": "During the greatest bull run in modern history, Japan's market hit an all-time high [PE ratio of 112.3](https://augurecon.com/indicator/japan/cape). Enjoy what you're seeing, because we're only at [\\~35 today](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). With no end in sight to the current market run, trying to value current fundamentals is insanity. There will be a pull back one day, but until then the market will continue to go exponential. you CAN get rich before then. People forget that before the great Depression people made a fuck-ton money and a lot of them got out before. Now we have circuit breakers and endless money printing and yet people are still afraid of a correction? [Even bears should invest at least in a high-yield bond ETF](https://etfdb.com/etfs/asset-class/bond/#etfs__dividends&sort_name=dividend_yield&sort_order=desc&page=1), some of which are yielding 15%(!) dividends. I'll spell it out for the financially illiterate: that means the safest asset class right now still lets you double your initial investment in 5 years.\n\nTl;dr: If you haven't been paying attention to the market, all you should know is today, in the year of our lord 2024, rationality is irrational. Up is down, left is right. Why can't NVDA/NVDU hit 200 EOY?",

Pixar's \"Inside Out\" just smashed box office records this weekend pulling in $155M domestically, and almost $300M globally. I fully expect to see movie theater stocks like IMAX, AMC, and CNK have a nice rebound after the early summer slump and post strike delays.\u00a0 And this was just the beginning of a stacked summer slate.\u00a0 Next up \u2013 Paramount\u2019s prequel \u201cA Quiet Place \u2013 Day One\u201d, followed by \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d, and then here comes the potential movie of the year \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d \u2013 which some are saying could be the highest grossing movie since the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo how do you play this trade?\u00a0 I like my chances with IMAX right now.\u00a0 \u00a0AMC\u2019s volatility get\u2019s a little meme-stock crazy and CNK has already been making their move the last two weeks now up almost 15% this month \u2013 so we may have missed some of those summer gains.\u00a0 But IMAX is in a great buying range -- still trading at the lower end of their 52-week range around $15.60/share \u2013 with a consensus price target at $23. \u00a0Historically, theater stocks tend to perform very well during the summer blockbuster season, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see IMAX trading closer to $20 by Labor Day if the upcoming releases continue to exceed expectations.  And with their premium screen formats and industry leading tech, IMAX is in the best position of all exhibitors to take advantage of made-for-big-screen movies like A Quiet Place and Deadpool.\u00a0\u00a0Get your popcorn out and happy trading.",

        "text": "Hello fellow regards. I'm the ADBE to the Abyss guy and I'm back with a new DD, this time on Lennar LEN. Inverse me by all means, you'll probably earn a profit this way.\n\nWhat is LEN? Lennar is a US nationwide homebuilder that serves the middle class and up.\n\nWhat is my thesis? There is no thesis. This is a purely quantitative play, no fundamental tailwinds or improving outlooks to back my trade. According to my new model, which compares investor sentiment and forecasted results, LEN looks poised to beat expectations during earnings tonight.\n\nWhat's my model? After the big ADBE fuckup, I theorized that earnings reactions are largely dictated by how much, or if earnings have beat investor expectations. I set to work on making a new model specifically designed for predicting the direction of earnings releases. The short version is, it uses seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average forecasting to obtain a possible EPS for the upcoming quarter and compares possible EPS growth to what I call sentiment percentage change. Sentiment percentage change is calculated with stock price performance, analyst EPS estimate revisions, and analyst EPS growth estimates. I backtested my model on a sample of around 40 earnings and reached an accuracy of roughly 70%, which I believe should give me an edge. What does this mean? It means that there's probably a 70% chance that Lennar will beat earnings tonight.\n\nMy current positions are 2 152.5 June 21st calls. I'm thinking about adding a third if I get enough confirmation bias on this post. Wish me luck.",

While everyone is busy FOMO-ing into Nvidia because of this AI surge, I\u2019ve been looking at the unsung hero in the background: ASML.\n\nFor the regards who don\u2019t know, ASML builds the freaking machines for making the chips. That\u2019s right, those same chips that Nvidia produces and every other tech company out there relies on. Nvidia can\u2019t do jack without ASML\u2019s tech, so why aren\u2019t we talking about them?\n\nNvidia has been printing tendies for us because of AI, but doesn\u2019t that mean ASML is a no-brainer? More demand for Nvidia chips = more demand for ASML\u2019s machines, right? Plus, with this tech war brewing, everyone\u2019s gonna need ASML\u2019s machines to stay competitive.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the play here? Are we sleeping on ASML? Is it time to YOLO into ASML before the rest of the market catches on? Drop your thoughts! ",

        "text": "Ladies and germs, lend me your rears. It's time for the next Great South American short story. But first, please note that this is NOT financial advice. It is however a work of utter genius, to be regarded in retrospect as a pioneering tract in the oeuvre of market literature. \n\nTL;DR: StoneCo is a fairly dope SA fintech company with quality financials yet rapidly increasing short interest. The dumb fucks who think they can chip away at this little gem deserve to be eaten alive by the intrepid marketeers going in on shares and OTM calls. \n\nStoneCo is a Brazilian fintech platform that serves SMBs with payments, loans, and now general banking services. Warren Buffett formerly held this stock in Berkshire, but divested sometime in 2023, about a year and change after a moderate crisis with their loan book. Long story short, they screwed up with some regulatory features and saw a ton of debts go bad. \n\nAfter recalibrating, the company returned to rapid growth and, better yet, significant profitability. The share price appreciated in kind. However, following their recent earnings report, the company has seen a surge in short interest (https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-stne-options-data-report-2024-06-15/#google\\_vignette). \n\nWith fairly impressive numbers since going public--2021 crisis notwithstanding--the only explanations for short pressure are:\n\n1. Increase in credit offerings has investors nervous about a crisis repeat. StoneCo has however installed ample loan loss reserves and bad loans are in line with or below industry averages.\n\n2. The company's CEO and chairman left last year. Their departure, somewhat unexplained, could be worrying investors.\n\n3. Revenue growth slowed to \"only\" 14% YoY--not really all that shabby considering their comps for growth were in the mid/high double digits.  \n\nMeanwhile, earnings increased 65% YoY, as management has only started to optimize ARPU. The cross selling between payments, credit, and banking will continue to accelerate margin expansion and, therefore, earnings growth. Even if StoneCo settles at a 10% revenue growth long term--quite a conservative estimate for a company in an industry seeing 17% CAGR--margin expansion will assure 15%+ earnings growth. \n\nTheir main competitor is likely Mercado Libre--the Amazon of South America--which has also muscled into the fintech space with great results thus far. There are a couple of others, but the market opportunity is massive, well more than enough to go around for the top players in the industry. The bad loan book aside, management has done a fantastic job, and it's difficult to imagine them not keeping apace with industry growth averages. \n\n$STNE now trades at under 12X TTM earnings, and less than 8X forward earnings. For a quality organization in a booming industry that just posted 65% growth, that's fucking cheap. The shorts have come in with the idea that they can scare investors away. \n\nAs LeBron notoriously proclaimed, \"It's time to take our talents to South America.\" \n\nRise up, regards. Let's juice this fucker. \n\nPositions:\n\n900 shares\n\n(1) $8.00 Long Call Expiry July 19, 2024\n\n(2) $14 Short Puts Expiry July 19, 2024\n\n(2) $12 Short Puts Expiry January 17, 2025\n\n(2) $11 Short Puts Expiry January 17, 2025",

AT&T and Google are onboard\n2. Verizon is onboard\n3. Vodafone is onboard (early investor)\n4. FirstNET is most likely onboard (check AST sub for most recent tweets)\n5. 5 BB1 satellite launch happening in 2-3 months\n6. 25% of float is currently short and ALL are underwater since price is rocketing.

Personally, I see Microsoft outlasting the other two, and never really falling out of top 5 anytime in the near future due to the vast amount of revenue streams and subsidiaries they own, and same for Apple due to how loyal their customers are. Nvidia really just depends on companies wanting and having a need to keep pushing for AI, and even then, I don't know if they can justify being the top company if their revenue is not matching. Personally I have long ITM Microsoft calls and nvidia shares, don't own Apple. What ate your thoughts?

        "text": "Hello my fellow regards. I think that ASTS is going to announce something big this week and I think it will likely be related to FirstNet. We all know ASTS has premier patented technology of something that would be incredibly useful to the United States defense. Now, ASTS released this video last week: [https://x.com/AST\\_SpaceMobile/status/1801589822517072008](https://x.com/AST_SpaceMobile/status/1801589822517072008)\n\nWhy would they release something like this if they're not about to get FirstNet funding from the US? To me, the writing is on the wall. \n\nFirstNet is basically a mission to deploy and maintain the first nation-wide wireless broadband network. FirstNet has an event on June 25-27 and I really think that given the ASTS video above they're telegraphing an announcement at this event. Source for event: [https://www.firstnet.gov/newsroom/press-releases/firstnet-authority-nist-announce-keynote-speakers-agenda-5x5-public-safety](https://www.firstnet.gov/newsroom/press-releases/firstnet-authority-nist-announce-keynote-speakers-agenda-5x5-public-safety)\n\nAll this to say, I've put a lot of my money into ASTS. Positions are:\n\n450 shares\n\n19 calls at $13 with 6/28 expo\n\n20 calls at $12.5 with 7/19 expo\n\nI'll probably buy more stock at open.",

Countries are also aiming to protect their national culture and security in an AI-dominated world. [\u2026]\u201d\n\n- \u201cNvidia\u2019s sovereign AI initiatives are expected to bring in nearly $10 billion this year, up from zero last year. This is a significant boost to the company\u2019s $26 billion in quarterly revenue, with almost half coming from major cloud-computing firms renting access to its chips.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this regard with a quote I thought was funny,\n\n_\u201dNew York University Stern School of Business Professor Aswath Damodaran, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cDean of Valuation,\u201d believes Nvidia\u2019s intrinsic value doesn\u2019t justify its current price tag. However, he acknowledged the company\u2019s achievements, stating, \u201cIf you are designing the perfect momentum company from scratch, Nvidia would be it.\u201d_\n\nTLDR: Jensen said \u201cI ain\u2019t hear no bell\u201d so therefore I\u2019ll be buying more calls because ~~HPE keynote~~, ~~Dow inclusion~~, ~~XLK tech fund repositioning~~, ~~healthcare~~, ~~Ethernet~~, ~~robotics~~, sovereign AI \u2014 I don\u2019t fuckin know, my attention span is limited, stonks go up",

        "text": "# Part 2 (there's another post somewhere on here)\n\nIt appears that while Tesla's sales declined in the first quarter of 2024, some other EV manufacturers actually saw significant increases in sales during the same period:\n\n1. Ford achieved a 97% year-over-year increase in EV sales in the first quarter of 2024, becoming the second-highest EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla\\[2\\]\\[5\\].\n2. Several luxury automakers saw impressive EV sales growth in Q1 2024 compared to the previous year\\[5\\]:\n   * Cadillac: 499.2% increase\n   * Mercedes: 66.9% increase\n   * BMW: 62.6% increase\n   * Audi: 28.8% increase\n3. In 2023, BYD briefly overtook Tesla as the world's bestselling EV brand in the fourth quarter\\[11\\].\n4. Globally, electric vehicle sales are projected to rise sharply in 2024, reaching 17 million units (a 21% increase from 2023), despite challenges in some markets\\[8\\].\n\nWhile Elon Musk attributed Tesla's sales decline to various factors such as factory shutdowns, shipping delays, an arson attack in Germany, and the introduction of an updated Model 3\\[6\\]\\[13\\], some analysts and investors believe Musk's controversial behavior and polarizing public statements have also contributed to the slowdown\\[1\\]\\[9\\]\\[13\\].\n\nMusk's claims do not fully explain why certain competitors like Ford and luxury brands saw strong EV sales growth while Tesla struggled. This suggests that company-specific issues, such as Musk's actions and their impact on Tesla's reputation\\[4\\]\\[9\\], may have played a role in addition to the broader challenges faced by the EV market.\n\nCitations:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240228-are-us-ev-sales-a-disaster-or-a-booming-segment-the-answer-may-be-both](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240228-are-us-ev-sales-a-disaster-or-a-booming-segment-the-answer-may-be-both)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09052024/inside-clean-energy-ford-electric-vehicles/](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09052024/inside-clean-energy-ford-electric-vehicles/)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.iea.org/commentaries/electric-cars-fend-off-supply-challenges-to-more-than-double-global-sales](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/electric-cars-fend-off-supply-challenges-to-more-than-double-global-sales)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119918/elon-musk-reputation-impact-tesla-falling-sales](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119918/elon-musk-reputation-impact-tesla-falling-sales)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q1-2024-ev-sales/](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q1-2024-ev-sales/)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-price-sales-electric-vehicle/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-price-sales-electric-vehicle/)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1227707306/ev-electric-vehicles-sales-2024](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1227707306/ev-electric-vehicles-sales-2024)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.cbtnews.com/electric-vehicle-sales-set-to-surge-in-2024-despite-affordability-challenges/](https://www.cbtnews.com/electric-vehicle-sales-set-to-surge-in-2024-despite-affordability-challenges/)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-blamed-contributing-teslas-202221977.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-blamed-contributing-teslas-202221977.html)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://abc7.com/post/elon-musk-accused-improperly-selling-75-billion-tesla/14917474/](https://abc7.com/post/elon-musk-accused-improperly-selling-75-billion-tesla/14917474/)\n\n\\[11\\] [https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/business/china-ev-industry-competition-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/business/china-ev-industry-competition-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\n\\[12\\] [https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog/post/57388/ev-startups-face-challenges-in-today%27s-market-](https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog/post/57388/ev-startups-face-challenges-in-today%27s-market-)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/03/how-much-is-elon-musk-to-blame-for-tesla-sales-slip](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/03/how-much-is-elon-musk-to-blame-for-tesla-sales-slip)\n\n\\[14\\] [https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-sales-decline-elon-musk-20613265](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-sales-decline-elon-musk-20613265)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-lay-off-more-than-10-its-staff-electrek-reports-2024-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-lay-off-more-than-10-its-staff-electrek-reports-2024-04-15/)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/nation-world/business/the-reason-is-elon-tesla-investor-blames-poor-sales-on-musks-x-posts/video\\_8010788b-645c-5510-a72e-ed598c95f0f8.html](https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/nation-world/business/the-reason-is-elon-tesla-investor-blames-poor-sales-on-musks-x-posts/video_8010788b-645c-5510-a72e-ed598c95f0f8.html)\n\n\n\n# PART 3\n\nElon Musk and Tesla have been inconsistent and potentially misleading about their plans for a new, more affordable electric vehicle model:\n\n1. In April 2024, Musk told investors that Tesla would deliver \"new vehicles, including more-affordable models\" by early 2025, earlier than the previously communicated timeline for a low-cost \"Model 2\" originally expected in late 2025\\[2\\]\\[16\\].\n2. However, these new affordable models seem to be different from the highly anticipated $25,000 \"Model 2\" that Tesla had been promising for years. Reuters reported in April 2024 that Tesla had abandoned plans for the Model 2\\[2\\]\\[16\\].\n3. When Reuters first reported the cancellation of the Model 2, Musk denied it on social media, calling the publication \"liars\"\\[1\\]. But Tesla's Q1 2024 financial results confirmed a change of plans - the new affordable vehicles would use existing platforms rather than the \"next-generation vehicle platform\" expected to enable cheaper production via an \"unboxed\" manufacturing process\\[1\\]\\[2\\].\n4. Tesla stated this change may result in less cost reduction than previously expected for the affordable models, suggesting they may cost more than the Model 2's anticipated $25,000 price\\[2\\]. Musk declined to provide specifics about the new vehicles\\[2\\].\n5. Some analysts interpreted Tesla's comments as confirmation that the dedicated Model 2 platform had indeed been shelved, contrary to Musk's earlier denial\\[2\\]. The company is focusing resources on the Robotaxi project instead\\[5\\].\n6. The inconsistent messaging came as Tesla faced slowing sales growth and increasing competition, especially from Chinese rivals like BYD\\[2\\]\\[10\\]. The Model 3 and Y, Tesla's current cheapest offerings, are aging compared to competitors\\[6\\]\\[9\\]\\[12\\].\n\nWhile Musk has continued to promise more affordable Teslas, the specific $25,000 Model 2 that generated much anticipation appears to have been canceled in favor of repurposed existing designs, despite his initial denial. The timing of the revised plans and Musk's shifting statements suggest an effort to reassure investors and counter negative press impacting Tesla's stock price. However, the lack of clarity around the capability and pricing of the upcoming vehicles relative to the original Model 2 concept raises questions about whether Tesla is actually on track to deliver the \"next-gen\" affordable EV platform it has long touted.\n\nCitations:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/](https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-promises-more-affordable-vehicles-cybercab/](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-promises-more-affordable-vehicles-cybercab/)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-quarterly-revenue-falls-first-time-since-2020-2024-04-23/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-quarterly-revenue-falls-first-time-since-2020-2024-04-23/)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.autoblog.com/2023/11/17/a-top-tesla-investor-said-he-plans-to-ditch-his-model-y-for-a-rivian-after-elon-musk-agreed-with-antisemitic-post/](https://www.autoblog.com/2023/11/17/a-top-tesla-investor-said-he-plans-to-ditch-his-model-y-for-a-rivian-after-elon-musk-agreed-with-antisemitic-post/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyRkL9m-1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyRkL9m-1k)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1897dwc/cybertruck\\_aside\\_tesla\\_hasnt\\_released\\_a\\_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1897dwc/cybertruck_aside_tesla_hasnt_released_a_new/)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://time.com/6336614/tesla-and-x-face-advertiser-and-investor-fallout-over-elon-musks-controversial-post/](https://time.com/6336614/tesla-and-x-face-advertiser-and-investor-fallout-over-elon-musks-controversial-post/)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.thestreet.com/technology/history-of-tesla-15088992](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/history-of-tesla-15088992)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.fastcompany.com/90945689/teslas-cybertruck-has-a-serious-problem-that-only-a-complete-redesign-can-fix](https://www.fastcompany.com/90945689/teslas-cybertruck-has-a-serious-problem-that-only-a-complete-redesign-can-fix)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-responds-tesla-byd-comparison/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-responds-tesla-byd-comparison/)\n\n\\[11\\] [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-reneges-on-order-agreement-car-price.218710/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-reneges-on-order-agreement-car-price.218710/)\n\n\\[12\\] [https://autos.yahoo.com/ancient-tesla-model-y-won-141500415.html](https://autos.yahoo.com/ancient-tesla-model-y-won-141500415.html)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/](https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/)\n\n\\[14\\] [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-musk-has-promised-new-low-cost-evs-but-tesla-has-none](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-musk-has-promised-new-low-cost-evs-but-tesla-has-none)\n\n# Part 4:\n\nIt appears that Tesla and Elon Musk may be facing several potential violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and other securities regulations:\n\n1. Inaccurate financial reporting: The whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC in 2021 alleged that Tesla had been miscategorizing repairs and hiding warranty costs for years, potentially misstating fundamental financial information\\[3\\]. If proven true, this could violate SOX requirements for accurate financial reporting and adequate internal controls (see part 5, this is still alive).\n\n2. Inadequate internal controls: The same whistleblower complaint raised concerns about Tesla's inconsistent communications and policies, which allegedly contributed to employees miscategorizing repair costs\\[3\\]. SOX requires companies to maintain effective internal control systems to ensure accurate financial reporting\\[7\\].\n\n3. Misleading statements about self-driving capabilities: Tesla faces legal and regulatory scrutiny over potentially false or misleading claims about its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems\\[1\\]. If Musk or other executives made materially false statements about the safety or capabilities of these systems, it could violate SOX provisions against knowingly submitting inaccurate information.\n\n4. Diversion of resources to other Musk ventures: Lawsuits allege that Musk breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla by diverting employees and resources to his other companies, like Twitter (now X)\\[1\\]. While not directly a SOX violation, this could indicate a lack of proper corporate governance and oversight.\n\n5. Insider trading allegations: Musk is facing multiple shareholder lawsuits accusing him of insider trading by selling large amounts of Tesla stock while aware of non-public information about the company's challenges\\[1\\]. Insider trading is a serious violation of securities laws.\n\n6. Delayed distribution of settlement funds: Tesla has accused the SEC of violating its own rules by failing to distribute $40 million in settlement funds to shareholders in a timely manner\\[5\\]. While not a direct SOX violation by Tesla, it highlights the complex regulatory environment the company operates in.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to these potential violations, SOX and other securities regulations generally require public companies to provide accurate, reliable financial reporting, maintain effective internal controls, and avoid misleading statements or omissions. The \"hype\" and controversy surrounding Tesla and Musk, including the allegations outlined above, suggest that the company may not be fully complying with these requirements.\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that many of these allegations are still being litigated or investigated, and have not been definitively proven. Tesla's stock price performance and Musk's continued promotion of the company's prospects indicate that many investors may still believe in the company's long-term potential, despite these regulatory challenges and governance concerns.\n\n\n\nCitations:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=45717](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=45717)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459022016871/tsla-10ka\\_20211231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459022016871/tsla-10ka_20211231-gen.pdf)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231-gen.pdf)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sec-is-violating-its-own-rules-by-holding-up-40-m-shareholder-payout-194905601.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-sec-is-violating-its-own-rules-by-holding-up-40-m-shareholder-payout-194905601.html)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231-gen.pdf)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://business-law-review.law.miami.edu/teslas-governance-challenges-navigating-the-complex-intersection-of-relationships-and-fiduciary-duties/](https://business-law-review.law.miami.edu/teslas-governance-challenges-navigating-the-complex-intersection-of-relationships-and-fiduciary-duties/)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://ir.tesla.com/\\_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k\\_20201231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231-gen.pdf)\n\n\n\n# Part 5: The Escapist\n\nIt appears that the 2021 whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC against Tesla regarding its accounting practices for warranty repairs has not been fully resolved.\n\n1. In 2021, Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that the company had been miscategorizing warranty repairs as \"goodwill\" since at least 2017, potentially allowing Tesla to avoid properly recording warranty expenses and inflate its earnings.\n2. The whistleblowers claimed that if Tesla had accurately categorized these repairs as warranty work, it would likely need to restate earnings for every quarter since at least 2017.\n3. However, according to a CNBC report in October 2023, the SEC looked at only one portion of the complaint and then closed the investigation without interviewing the whistleblowers or evaluating the 18,000 files of documentation they provided.\n4. One of the whistleblowers, Lukasz Krupski, then leaked the so-called \"Tesla Files\" to the media in late 2023, leading to court injunctions and warnings from Tesla.\u00a0Krupski received a whistleblowing prize in 2023 for his efforts.\n5. The leaked data also implicated Tesla in serious data protection lapses, with sensitive employee information being readily accessible on internal systems.\u00a0Dutch authorities are investigating whether this violated privacy laws as of November 2023.\n6. As of October 2023, there is no indication that the SEC has reopened its investigation or taken any enforcement action against Tesla based on the whistleblowers' accounting fraud allegations.\n\nWhile the 2021 whistleblower complaint raised serious concerns about Tesla's accounting practices and treatment of warranty costs, the SEC's initial investigation appears to have been brief and limited in scope. The subsequent leak of internal Tesla data in 2023 brought renewed attention to the allegations, but there is no clear resolution of the accounting fraud claims as of the latest information in the provided search results. The whistleblowers' concerns about Tesla's financial reporting remain largely unaddressed by regulators.",

They have to let the MBS and longer term treasuries they own role of their balance sheets as they expire.   This will take time.  \nI'm happy though that the M2 supply is not currently growing.  But to draw a line through the data points that is still going up doesn't give much comfort.   The Federal Govt is still overspending by trillions.   When they are finally forced to pull back I wonder how big a disruption it will be to reallocate the resources.\nThe OP also fails to realize that an awful lots of dollars aren't even accounted for because they are off shore.

Because I don't have the whole portfolio in NVDA.\n\nA few things to get out of the way in case people ask\n\nPortfolio now is about  \n\\~3M in different ETF, QQQM, VOO, SCHD, etc  \n\\~1M in SNSXX which is a treasury based money market fund  \n\\~500K in other individual stocks, also heavy on tech (AAPL, MSFT, TSMC mostly)  \n\\~5.5M in NVDA\n\nI think the discord on NVDA here is too extreme, either that it will tank immediately or that it will moon immediately.  I think the answer is more nuanced.  It is actually now at a point that it is very difficult to say which way the stock will go.  \n\nBull's case:  \n- Blackwell will change the game from selling GPU to selling whole solution.  This has potentially the largest immediate bump in financial in the next 2Q.  I think it will be apparent in Aug's guidance to see if there is some real crazy guide coming out or not.  This is probably the most concrete immediate bull case.  \n- AI is real, there is no way the big players will try to save money to lose the race.  This does not only include CSP.  Enterprise and Nation States will need to get in ASAP too.  \n- There are other real long shot also where AI break through actually enable new market.  Medical research vastly boosted by AI.  Actual FSD being massively adapted and NVDA's automotive business take off drastically.\n\nBear's case:  \n- Competition catching up, NVDA's moat (TCO) lose strength  \n- Actual recession to slow down NVDA's customer's spending  \n- Taiwan and War\n\nWith this comparison I would like to think that bull's case has more chance to play out.  However Are we going to see massive upside like what we had in the last 18 months?  Not unless market goes really irrational.  And I am not sure if I would like that.  ",

I think we can expect big investors to move large amounts of capital back into the market as a recession forms since this would coincide with or proceed interest rate drops; they like the returns they are getting on treasuries and CD's and will want to keep up the pace.

That's what NVDA accelerates: the training of those models (along other scientific simulation tasks, but not relevant here) \nLMM are quite powerful in the right scenarios but the also have their limits and drawbacks. \nIt is unlikely that we ever achieve something like the singularity with LMM.\nSo maybe there will be a breakthrough in AI research that doesn't rely on LLM - and maybe that will need a different kind of hardware, not made by NVDA.\nOr, and this is more realistic in my view, the overhyped expectations of what AI can do for us in the next few years will be corrected - and the stock market with it.\nAlso, currently AI companies do basically what they want, pirating the whole reachable Internet for training data. That can change, with several pending lawsuits.\nThe high cost of suitable training data paird with compute costs and the possibility that some of the usage scenarios may never get to satisfactory results may just render some business cases unviable.\nCurrently,  everybody is developing to be the first and does not worry too much about monetisation.

        "text": "Why:\n\nTesla sales have been slowing and tesla inventory has been building. This is apparent from reports of inventory build up around their factories, Q1 reporting, layoffs, and the April 2nd update.  The following site also shows an inventory increase but I do not trust this source entirely since some of the basic functionality on this site is broken. [https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google\\_vignette](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google_vignette)\n\nThe recent tesla layoffs (late April) were a crossed the board and un-structured; reported as \\~10% of the workforce. I suspect that it may have been larger than that but have nothing to back that up. They were un-structured as employees were given no notice and some key divisions were let go in mass (supercharger team) which were later brought back on. Employees were given 2 months of severance pay to prevent a WARN act lawsuit. Payment was scheduled to go out 45 days after termination. All in all we can expect that for this quarter payroll will be approximately unchanged for Q2 reporting while production efficiency will have been reduced by more than 20% (reduced moral, key employees will have been let go, other employees will need retraining to fill vital roles). this means less than 80% of the work for 100% of the pay which means reduced margins in Q2.\n\nSpeculation: Tesla does not have updated models that would entice current model 3/Y (their bread and butter) owners to buy a new Tesla. Most people who wanted a Tesla have already bought one. Competition in the EV market is building; many auto makers now have EV's available that are more attractive to the every day driver.\n\nTesla is way behind now on autonomous vehicles. Waymo is already online in Phoenix and San Francisco and is being brought online in LA. Tesla rejected radar and lidar technology which is rapidly decreasing in cost. GM, Hyundai, BMW and other manufactures already have level 2 advanced cruise control (this is what FSD is) online. BMW will be releasing a level 3 ACC soon. Tesla dropped the ball and is already late to the market for fully autonomous cars and is falling behind on level 2 ACC. \n\n [https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/)\n\nTesla's robot, optimus, has not been shown to do anything useful beyond acting as a pick and place machine (these have existed since the 80's). Optimus can barely walk and is far behind Boston Dynamics (mostly owned by Hyundai). Optimus is a dead end and a pipe dream; Tesla is many years behind other companies and it's not clear if this technology will be useful considering the competitive wages of overseas workers. \n\nAfter the vote last week TSLA shot up in the pre-market then fell on Thursday and Friday. My guess is that a few, or even one, large share holder was backing out of Tesla; this was expected since this was a very divisive vote. The fan boi's have been pushing Tesla stock hard lately and although I have no proof I suspect that many influencers on youtube, twitter, and main stream media are somehow profiting through a back door means to pump Tesla and have been for some time. I have the feeling that most of us, or at least the people who have enough control to actually move markets, are seeing through Elon's BS and just need a catalyst to take a closer look and drop TSLA from their portfolio's.\n\nWhat:\n\nI plan to use \\~10% of my portfolio to buy out of the money puts on 1JUL24 expiring 19JUL24. Strike price should be about -10% from stock price at that time. Depending on the severity of the 2JUL24 report from Tesla I may see either a sudden drop or a slow decline in the stock price leading into 17JUL24. After market on 17JUL24 I am expecting another drop and will close my position at market open 18JUL24 with out regard to price.\n\n",

        "text": "Every stock market bubble has been the same. Human psychology is one of the seven wonders of the world because through centuries and centuries, people truly never learn. \"This time it's different,\" \"the market will never go down again\", \"those old fundamentals don't matter anymore\", \"printer go brrrr.\" Every \"investor\" of the last 15 years (basically anyone under 40) has never even seen a true bear market in stocks or real estate and has absolutely no clue the carnage that is coming. \n\nWe just saw quantitative easing and 15 years of zero interest rate policy, something never done before. The madness of this decision still escapes me. Alan Greenspan, who was largely blamed for too much of an \"easy monetary policy\" that created both the dot com bubble of 2000 AND GFC of 2008, didn't even come near the absolutely INSANE and irresponsible levels of easy monetary conditions of the last 15 years. The economy was flooded with money and loans flowed like milk and honey. And people really thought there would be no consequences? Both asset and consumer price inflation went through the fucking roof. There's no other way to put it. We will look back on this time in 5-10 years after the dust settles and wonder how the fuck this was allowed to happen. \n\nHowever, this easy monetary period is now history and we are staring down the barrel of the very first ever legit campaign of QT, something never seen before. They tried it in 2017 and bitched out because of how poorly the market reacted. This no longer becomes an option due to the high and stubborn inflation we have now (by the way, I don't think inflation is truly going anywhere, i.e. meaningfully and sustainably below 2%, until the Fed absolutely curb stomps the economy and sucks trillions more out of the system. Either that or the economy and banking system completely shit the bed dealing with the higher for longer rates).\n\nAlmost every fundamental valuation metric is at all time highs (or just below the all time highs of the dot com bubble). P/E, price/sales, market cap/GDP are all at eye watering levels. Point is, fundamentals ALWAYS matter in the end. Always. It has always been the case and the market has always come back to reality, whether it was the dutch tulip bulb crisis, the crash of 29, or the dot com bubble. The recession/crash usually happens when most people become bullish again (this is currently happening in nearly every sentiment survey today).\u00a0\n\nI think the big one is right around the corner. One last fun consideration: the QQQ hit a GFC low of 25.74 on March 9th 2009, just over 15 years ago. On Friday, it reached a new all time high of 479.19. Please let this sink in for the people in the back....A major index is up over 1700% in just over 15 years and averaged an annual return of greater than 21%/year during that period. Be aware, this return doesn't even include dividends.\u00a0\n\nIf it instead generated a very solid 10%/year over that time, it'd be sitting at 107.52 representing a drop of 78% from today's price. Mind you, during crashes indexes tend to become overly cheap (not fair priced) as emotions and momentum tend to dictate movement on either end of extremes (too bullish or too bearish).\u00a0\n\nI reiterate my stance that major indices could lose 60-70%+ before the next secular bull market. Possibly more. Jokers like NVDA that sit at over 40X price/sales will become absolutely steam rolled and lose 80-90% or more. You think the FOMO buying was crazy investor behavior, just wait until people start making mad dashes for the exit. The fact that a bunch of brainless, misguided retail investors can sell in an instant with the push of a button should be very very frightening. We aren't just in a new era of investing, we are in a new era of panic selling. We will learn just how crazy investor psychology is when the circuit breakers start rolling back in   \u00a0\n\nThe time of the bear is nearly upon us  I have no doubt SPY will be back under 200 before all is said and done and i can't wait to buy in the firesale that is coming ",

They have been taught (correctly btw) that it doesn't matter what the market does because over long periods of time you come out way ahead.\nSo keep that in mind because it's less and less financial advisors hand picking stocks and rebalancing portfolios between bonds, stocks, etc as they try to \"predict\" the market.

I have been tempted to follow someone else (Seeking Alpha Picks or Medallion picks I can dig up) due to lack of time.  Time is really hard to find with my hectic job, my little boy, and taking care of my aging mother who has dementia.  Alternatively, I will reduce my # of holdings and simplify.  Just wondering what you all do and how many holdings are too many.  ",

It's been trading cheap over the past 12 months largely due to EPA/Lead worries and other economic risks. Despite this, major iPhone enhancements/upgrades historically led to significant VZ gains.\n\n# Factors to Consider\n\n1. **Historical Impact of iPhone Upgrade Cycles**: Historically, major iPhone releases have led to increased sales and activations for telecom companies. For example, previous upgrade cycles have seen spikes in new customer acquisitions and higher data plan sales.\n2. **5G Expansion**: Verizon\u2019s ongoing investment in 5G technology is likely to align well with new iPhone models, especially if they leverage advanced 5G capabilities. This could lead to higher customer demand for Verizon's 5G services.\n3. **Market Trends and Analyst Forecasts**: Current analyst forecasts project Verizon\u2019s stock to have an average price target of $43.8 in the next 12 months without factoring in a new iPhone cycle\u200b ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/vz/forecast/))\u200b.\n\n# Estimating the Impact\n\nTo estimate the potential impact of an iPhone upgrade cycle, we can look at the effect of previous major upgrades on Verizon's stock price and adjust current projections accordingly. Let's assume a 5-10% positive impact based on historical data and the increased demand for 5G services.\n\nVerizon's stock price should reach **$55-60** in 12 months. This estimation is based on historical impacts of iPhone releases, current market conditions, and the assumption that the upgrade cycle would have a positive effect similar to past cycles. Plus, don't forget, you're getting a nice divi every quarter while you wait for the iPhone pop.",

They have the most advanced chips, and because they\u2019re already using AI to help them design next generation chips, no matter what, they will ALWAYS be massively ahead of the competition. \n\nThey own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.\n\nhttps://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-10_chipnemo-domain-adapted-llms-chip-design\n\nhttps://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/tsmc-synopsys-nvidia-culitho#:~:text=NVIDIA%20also%20introduced%20new%20generative,over%20current%20CPU%2Dbased%20methods.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/itf-world-2023/\n\nAnyone who thinks or says \u201ccompetitors will catch up\u201d is a moron, and you should run far, far away from them.\n\nEDIT:\nGains & Position:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3HefJhK",

Classic GPU's are now less than 20% of their revenue. Their AI designs are not best in class. Their CUDA software platform is dominant but it really just a variant of a standard math library. Do they make great stuff - yes. Do they push TSMC to the edge - yes but so does every memory/CPU/Flash producer.  AI is significant enough that it is getting its own datacenter solutions. The way NVIDIA builds out AI is very limiting as FB reported - with the arrays 33% underutilized because of design limits. Cerebras destroys NVIDIA in AI.  Intel, having fabs (vs fabless) COULD be a serious competitor as a supplier through a Dell or HP etc. Google rolls their own and has predating NVIDIA's play. Microsoft and Amazon are rolling their own.  Its just not that hard.  This is akin to Ethernet 1998 wherein Cisco ran the board but its now multisourced with Avago (Broadcom) providing silicon to every in-house design.  AMD also has fabs and serious AI development. Tesla (DOJO) has incredible AI development.  \nBasically its the Wild West and there are 100's of players. NVIDIA is dominant because they have the slots in the DC's but the number of competitors is enormous. Models are somewhat portable and NOT reliant on NVIDIA to run. There is no secret sauce in NVIDIA hardware. AI is linear algebra. Anyone can do it. Quantum Computing currently does it the best.\nFor those interested the benchmarks for performance are called MLPERF.  \nThere are many great websites full of reviews but the oldest most read source is \"Microprocessor Report\".",

There was a rumor that NVDA is using an accounting loophole, but it's unclear if this is true or just a joke.\nWhile some people are worried about a market crash, others are making jokes about shorts and giving financial advice in a tongue-in-cheek manner. One user commented that doctors shouldn't earn more than 50k, which sparked a discussion about the value of different professions.\nA conversation about the benefits of advanced compute and AI turned into debating the intrinsic value of gold, Bitcoin, and US dollars, with one user arguing that only food, water, shelter, and security have any real value.\nMany comments reference memes and inside jokes, such as 'round tripping', 'being a bear', 'bagholding', and 'loss porn'. There are also references to recent news stories, such as the ship stuck in the Suez Canal, and Elon Musk's",

There is also concern about the number of people living paycheck to paycheck despite the gains made by major indices.\n\n\nTwo individuals joke that their fathers have been pulled over by the police and had to perform an unsavoury act to get out of trouble. \n\n\nSeveral are bullish on the GRND stock, going so far as to use the ticker symbol as a one-word rallying cry.",

        "text": "Many companies have spoken about AI and how they will incorporate it into their products and services. Including Apple, where they revealed information about their AI iPhone and their stock ripped from $190 to $220 a share on this news. People are acting like the .com bubble but with AI, any major company that mentions \u201cAI\u201d their stocks get rewarded. However, this is not justified IMO because as of right now, I have not heard how AI will generate more revenue but only how it will make things more efficient/convenient for their customers. Just like with Apple, there was no mention of how they will profit from AI, and all of the features they mentioned are cool but not to the point where people want to go out and buy the new iPhone because of it. Just like in the .com era, mentioning you have a website was all you needed to say as a company for your stock to be rewarded. Even now companies are not laying out a clear plan on how they will generate this increase in revenue that people assume will come with AI and that is priced in. AI is just going to be another tool companies use to cut costs and stay competitive, and once the hype slows down and the market opens its eyes to this simple fact, we could see a correction.",

Tellurian is a company that has had some delays on construction of infrastructure, but if you look who the TOP shareholders are, you will see that they won\u2019t lose.  It\u2019s only a matter of time for them to finish construction now.  It\u2019s an AMERICAN Liquified Natural Gas company.   Too much to say here, but worth looking into it.  They aren\u2019t profitable at all and that\u2019s why the stock went from 20 dollars to now 70 Cents.   It will go to 50 Dollars.  It\u2019s definitely a company that will trade at a 30 to 50 B market cap.  It\u2019s at 700 M right now.  It\u2019s like buying inv\u00eddia 7 years ago and holding until now.    I recommend you guys look into it.  Even if they sell the company for infrastructure scraps, it\u2019s worth already 2 to 3Billion at least just in infrastructure , not to mention the permits they were the last ones to get, and ever since Biden took office, no competition has even got close to consider jumping in the market.  They have only 2 others to compete for the LNG in the US .  They are working on a deal to partner up with the Saudis.  If that happens and American realizes it needs to go back to energy independence and export of LNG , TELLURIAN will jump like no other stock.  For real look into it , you won\u2019t regret.   I bought 900 K worth of this stock back in December at 0.65.    I won\u2019t sell it until it hits 20 dollars at least.   Worth your time.  This is the last chance to get in this stock bellow 1 dollar.  Predictions are crazy high  for the next 7 years.",

        "text": "Everyone knows the story. A one stop shop for all your financial needs, the Apple of finance, the AWS of fintech... but the stock has not moved in over a year and is down 38% since its IPO. Probably mostly due to being overhyped at first, the macro uncertainty at the moment and the thought that this \\*bank\\* has not been tested on a real difficult macro environment. I probably wont say anything new existing bulls don't already know though, as the stock is cultish and has a very loyal following\n\nHowever, in recent months, due to the constant negative stock price action there has been a real increase in negative sentiment on social media, with people saying that they are capitulating or are desperate to sell at the next uptick, and sofi bulls are being trashed all over social media, with bears being increasingly vocal as well. This increased so much so that even on SoFi Stock subreddit the mods said that they started letting more and more posts and comments straight up trashing the stock through, in part due to their large volume I believe.\n\nTrading/investing on sentiment alone is never a good idea, \\*unless\\* the sentiment is trending in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. What's more, although insiders are net sellers atm, the CEO keeps buying the stock on every single dip, and institutional ownership has increased from around 32% to over 41% over the past year.\n\nWhy do I believe the fundamentals are trading in the opposite direction?\n\n1. SoFi is valued like a moderately fast growing bank even though their pace of growth in margins and earnings for now is that of a tech company.\n   * Their current P/B value (used to value banks) sits at around 1.17, with an all time high of 4.32 and low of 0,78, while JP Morgan is currently valued at 1.82. To be fair, JP Morgan's growth in book value per share has been 13.2% over the past 12 months, while SoFi's has been -0.9%, due to dilution.\n   * Despite this, management has been determined to lower SBC as the company matures, and at the moment are in growth mode, focused on scaling their multiple business segments to make up 33% of their revenue each, this includes: Lending (currently significantly overweight in terms of revenue share), Financial Services, Tech Platform.\n2. The current growth rate projected by management takes into account extremely conservative assumptions:\n   * Lending is set to grow around 0% percent this year, as is management's conscious decision, reflecting an uncertain macro environment, with that rate having the potential to explode once default rates stabilize and projections are more clear.\n   * Financial services are currently growing by more than 70% each year and are expected to grow by at least 50% every year for the next few years.\n   * Tech platform is set to grow by at least 20% Y/Y. \n   * All of these rates assume no new product launches or \"unexpected\" sources of revenue. However, management has hinted that they are in talks with multiple top financial institutions about tech platform implementation, with \"a top 5 US bank\" having tested a proof of concept. This platform would help the banks switch from their old legacy software to one that is a lot more robust and able to accommodate modern online banking needs, as well as having people who actually know the coding language and so can help if any technical difficulties arise. Thing is, galileo is based in part on infrastructure-as-a-service model that allows SoFi to generate revenue based on their clients' size, for example generating a small profit every time a transaction is made on one of their clients' platforms. Having a large bank as their client would significantly accelerate their growth rate.\n3. They turned profitable this year, and EPS growth is expected to continue, but not everyone is convinced.\n   * They expect to grow from projected 0,08 in 2024 c to at least 0.50 to 0.80 c by 2026, which if done and continued would significantly aid in growing book value, if not demand a higher multiple, currently being at around 81 FWD PE (2024), but 13 FWD PE (2026).\n   * The analysts and financial institutions are sceptical about this growth rate, and this is in part where the opportunity lies. The growth targets have been called \"aspirational\", and the first quarter that SoFi turned profitable, one analyst basically asked if they were rigging numbers.\n   * There has also been some controversy surrounding their accounting, as they are using a method that assumes they would sell their loans rather than hold them to maturity, and the scepticism was that they would fail to sell due to reducing demand which would force them to account for higher losses on their balance sheet. However, they have demonstrated that even their unsecured loans are of the highest quality (FICO scores more than 750), and trusted by the market, by selling a significant number of their loans last quarter.\n4. People are mostly happy with the product, SoFi is well rated, and their deposits are insured up to 2 mil due to the banking license, so customers probably feel their money is safe as well. They are dilligent with their product launches, the CEO has hinted that they were slow with Zelle implementation for example to ensure customers' security. Crypto has currently been discontinued, but the talks are ongoing with regulators, and with all the recent product launches, such as the crypto ETFs, it may come back at some point.\n5. The management seems nimble, with Anthony Noto at the forefront, having kept up their growth rates despite losing their largest business segment (Student loans) a few years back, having completely transformed the business, and now focusing on improving other segments rather than unsecured loans when the default rates are still rising, this makes me trust their guidance a little more.\n\nInvesting in this company requires trusting that the managements' projections are honest and potentially conservative, and that they are able to execute, which they currently have a history of doing. There is a lot of mistrust in the market, however, which may be founded, but just seems overdone at the moment.\n\nThe bet would be that they sign up a large client within the next few quarters and significantly raise their guidance, which could make current price seem like peanuts.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I believe SoFi may currently be Underhyped.",

Because their member base and deposit base are also growing.

Right now I say no, but maybe if rates drop again and people want to look into refinance it may be a decent play",
