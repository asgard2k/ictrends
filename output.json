        "text": "Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.\n\n# Stock Performance\n\nFirst off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so there\u2019s definitely room for growth.\n\n# What's New with IonQ?\n\nIonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and it\u2019s a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.\n\n# Management Changes\n\nThey\u2019ve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the company\u2019s strategy and growth. Plus, they\u2019ve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.\n\n# Industry Positioning\n\nIonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platforms\u2014Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means they\u2019re super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.\n\n# Financials\n\nFinancially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. They\u2019ve got a lot of cash on hand\u2014$434.4 million\u2014so they\u2019re in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.\n\n# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?\n\nNow, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If you\u2019re looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.\n2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but they\u2019re not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.\n3. **Valuation**: IonQ\u2019s stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIA\u2019s, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.\n\nIn summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.",

        "text": "OK so this is purely speculative, but is anyone else following the flight attendant labor negotiations at American Airlines? On June 5 the flight attendants union rejected a pay offer. Said they were meeting for one more week as a last ditch effort. They are prepared to strike, but have to be released from mediation first. Obviously a flight attendant strike during peak travel season would be crushing to AAL in the short term.\n\nIt\u2019s now June 20, and there have been no updates since. Maybe that means negotiations are actually making progress. I\u2019m not sure how much the threat of striking is built in to the current share price- I would think that a deal getting done would cause at least a small pop in price.\n\nIf there is a strike though, I\u2019d expect a pretty sharp (short term drop). Right now I have small positions (even smaller after today) in both otm calls and puts. Need to do some more DD and will increase my position accordingly. \n\nDD to follow. Specifically I\u2019m going to look at share price activity during/after the pilot labor negotiations last year. \n\nAnyone have any experience tracking share price vs labor negotiations?",

        "text": "[Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, a few years after the Dot Com bubble](https://medium.com/@Bentan1/what-were-you-thinking-fea15ec6c09d):\n\n>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?",

More relevant for tech stocks is PEG or a \"growth minded\" P/E that tries to capture projected earnings growth alongside P/E. As it stands, you still won't be able to find a tech stock with more robust financials than NVDA. They have basically no debt and are still undervalued. The reason why they're going up is really a flight to quality.

                "body": "You have to consider possible outcomes beyond looking at past performance and future projections based off current trends. Right now, Nvidia is benefiting from GenAI hype that requires training and inferencing with massive foundation models. Right now, Nvidia's primary customers are the other big tech companies including the big 3 cloud companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Mix in some Meta and Tesla. Right now, the hundreds of billions in GenAI investment has very little to show for it in terms of viable business models (revenue generation, profitability). If this doesn't materialize soon you could see investors demand the big tech companies to back off their annual GPU infrastructure spend. If the big tech companies stop upgrading GPU clusters every year or do so at smaller scale that will impact Nvidia meaningfully.\nFurthermore, foundation models aren't economically viable right now. They cost too much to train and inference. You could very well see a shift from general purpose massive foundation models to smaller expert models that are particularly good at one narrow task. I work in AI/ML as an applied scientist and am seeing this shift in thought. Smaller models are cheaper to train and inference and make sense economically. This will reduce the demand for state of the art massive GPUs made by Nvidia.\nLastly, every single one of Nvidia's primary customers is looking to reduce their dependency on Nvidia GPUs by building their own AI accelerators. The point isn't to completely replace Nvidia but to supplement their demand for Nvidia GPUs with their own solutions. Microsoft has their Maia accelerator being made by TSMC. Google has their TPU accelerator being made by Broadcom. Amazon has their Trainium and Inferentia accelerators. Apple has their own on-device accelerators with M1/M2 and neural engine on mobile and apparently are getting into server level accelerators as part of Apple Intelligence push. Meta has their MTIA accelerator. Tesla has their Dojo D1/D2 accelerator. You have Groq LPU which outperforms during inference. Then you have AMD with their accelerator lineup for the next few years and RoCm to compete with CUDA. You have tons of big tech companies teaming up to open source standards for networking and accelerator computing to eliminate Nvidia vendor lock. If these companies are able to reduce their demand for Nvidia chips particularly on the lower end then you will see Nvidia revenue growth grind to a halt or decline and what's worse their profitability could contract considerably with less demand.

I had bought some shares in Kroger a while back; still have 5 left (3 if my sell order goes through); currently at a profit for my shares. With all this said, I just don't understand how this would be the market reaction:\n\n\"In corporate news, Kroger(KR) posted a surprise fiscal Q1 revenue increase and stronger-than-expected earnings per share while affirming its 2024 outlook despite hurdles in the pharmacy business. The shares fell 3.5%.\" -MT NEWSWIRES\n\nRevenue increase and stronger than expected earnings + affirming it's 2024 outlook but the shares dropped? What am I missing here?\n\nThinking it through as I typed this, keyword \"shares fell\" not \"share prices fell\" ... could someone with actual market IQ confirm if that's my disconnect; want to take the opportunity to learn.",

Earlier this week, I started buying puts expiring July 26, expecting NVDA to start to peak and trade flat this week and expecting the T+35 FTDs to start showing the results of the profit taking following NVDA\u2019s post-earnings rally (the same trend after their Q4 earnings report). As NVDA kept going higher, I kept doubling down. When NVDA became the largest company by market cap on Tuesday, I set an alert to buy puts an hour and a half after market open. I sold 15/50 puts at a 300%+ gain to have a slight profit over my entire trade and now I\u2019m playing with house money. I\u2019m expecting NVDA to drop to 130 or possibly even less by EOW so my next price target to sell 20 more puts will be 130.",
